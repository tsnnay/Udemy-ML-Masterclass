    "Understanding hyperplanes and margin classifiers in fundamental to understanding SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Hyperplane?\n",
    "In a N-dimensional space, a hyperplane is a flat affine subspace of hyperplane dimension N-1. For ex:\n",
    "* For 1-D, Hyperplane is a single point\n",
    "* For 2-D, Hyperplane is a line and so on\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why we bother with hyperplanes?\n",
    "The main idea is to use hyperplane to create separation between classes (fancy way of saying different types of data points). Our hope is such a hyperplane exists which can bifurcate differencing points in the space\n",
    "\n",
    "### Baby Chick Example\n",
    "1-D dataset of baby chicks (male or female) is plotted on a line, with maleo on RHS and female on LHS. Visually, data is easily separable.\n",
    "\n",
    "I this dataset, a single point in the middle of dataset can easily separate both datasets, but issue is **placing of the point**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Where to Place the Point?**\n",
    "Many points exists which can perfectly separate the points. We use a separator that maxifies the margin between hyperplane and first instance of each class. Such an hyperplane which maximises the margins is called __Maximum Margin Classifier__\n",
    "\n",
    "Same example can be applied in 2-D space, where classes are separated by line, but there are $\\inf$ lines which can separate. Again, we use maximise the margin (distance) between line and data points (each data point 2D vector here)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unseparable Classes?\n",
    "NOt all classes will be easily separable (at least visually) showin in Fig. A single point will mess up at least one class, so we need to chose our poison. Our decision is guided by Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bias Variance Tradeoff**\n",
    "Example _ and _ show how one can overfit hard to one particular dataset (however no. of point misclassified is same i.e. 1 in both cases). But it is obvious our classifier skews heavily female in _ and male in _. This can bite us in ass when we decide to test or deploy the model\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **high variance fit**. In example _, it was \"picking too much noise from female data\" and thus, overfitting it or had a high variance w.r.t female data points. We can introduce **bias** for more logical classifier, even at the cost of training accuracy. This misclassification doing margin is called a *_soft margin_*, which allows for miscallsification within itself. We manipulate soft margin with introduction of bias. \n",
    "\n",
    "**But again, there are multiple threshold splits of soft margin, and **Maximum Margin** concept is already applied, so what else we can do to get optimum *soft margin*.**\n",
    "The answer lies in level of misclassification to be allowed. With *misclassification* as our north-star, we perform *Cross Validation* to figure out best *soft margin* amongst all.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Soft Margin Demonstraion\n",
    "Maximum margin classifer in this example skews heavily female, due to picking \"too much variance or too much noie\" from the female set. The highlighted figure _ shows Male classification zone is too larger than what seems necessary, and it can cause problems in test set. So, there is need to soften the margin we got from *Maximum Margin Classifer*\n",
    "\n",
    "So we introduce a new classifier, that allows for *soft margins*, called a *Support Vector Classifier*\n",
    "\n",
    "**What happens when Hyperplane theory falls on it face?**\n",
    "Cases _ and _ demonstrate the respective hyperplanes (point and lines resp.) fail here. Using multiple points can solve the issue in case _, but in _, group of lines is not gonna help much\n",
    "\n",
    "*In general, higher dimesions make it difficult to use multiple hyperplanes*\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's the limitation of *Support Vector Classifier* and rationale to move on to *Suppport Vector Machines*\n",
